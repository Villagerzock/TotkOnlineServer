For anyone Wanting to test it, right now i have only tested it on windows but its java so it should work on linux and mac aswell except for debian maybe because that only has a console and it uses GLFW Windows

but here are the Testing commands for executing the server in the Terminal

Executing Server

java -jar "C:\Path\To\The\Server-1.0-SNAPSHOT-shaded.jar"

and Executing Test Client for connection

java -cp "C:\Path\To\The\Server-1.0-SNAPSHOT-shaded.jar" net.villagerzock.testClient.SimpleTestTCPClient
